## ðŸ”§ Contents

This repository includes implementations of algorithms and problem-solving tasks covered in the lab sessions, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, MST)
- Greedy algorithms (Huffman Coding, Activity Selection, etc.)
- Divide and Conquer techniques
- Dynamic Programming
- And more!

Each lab task is organized by week and includes well-documented code in C/C++/Python (based on what you used).
